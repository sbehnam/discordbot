# discordbot
my very first question is, how to get start with visual studio 2017 to create a discord bot based on java language?
I initialized npm install discord.js
I tried to make a new solution on VS 2017 based on node.js
So as used Ctrl+Shift+N to create a new project, there is a window asking for droplist JavaScript and Node.js; So which one i have to choose and how can i add discord libraries via VS 2017? options are: 
1. From existing Node.js Code;
2. Blank Node.js Console application;
3. Blank Node.js Web application; and
4. Blank Azure Node.js Web application.
other options are useless as i found!
